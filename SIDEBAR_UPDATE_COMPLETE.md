## ðŸŽ¯ Sidebar Layout Update - Completed!

I have successfully modified the sidebar to move **Reports**, **Alerts**, and **Admin** modules to the bottom of the sidebar as requested.

### âœ… Changes Made

**File Modified:** `src/components/app-sidebar-rbac.tsx`

### ðŸ”„ What Changed

**Before:** All modules were displayed in a single vertical list in the order:
- Dashboard
- Purchase  
- Sales
- Finance
- Maintenance
- HR (with submenu)
- Reports
- Alerts
- Admin (with submenu)

**After:** Modules are now split into two groups:

**Top Group (Main Operations):**
- Dashboard
- Purchase
- Sales  
- Finance
- Maintenance
- HR (with submenu)

**Bottom Group (Management & Analysis):**
- Reports
- Alerts  
- Admin (with submenu)

### ðŸŽ¨ Technical Implementation

1. **Module Grouping:** Split `availableModules` into `topModules` and `bottomModules`
2. **Layout Structure:** Used flexbox with `flex-1` spacer to push bottom modules down
3. **Visual Separation:** Added proper spacing between groups
4. **Maintained Functionality:** All existing features (collapsible menus, active states, RBAC) preserved

### ðŸš€ Result

The sidebar now has:
- **Top section:** Core business modules (Dashboard through HR)
- **Flexible spacer:** Automatically adjusts to available space
- **Bottom section:** Reports, Alerts, and Admin modules positioned at the bottom
- **Footer:** User profile and logout buttons remain at the very bottom

### âœ… Verification

The application is running at http://localhost:3000 with the new sidebar layout. You can now see:
- Reports, Alerts, and Admin modules grouped at the bottom of the sidebar
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- All functionality maintained (role-based access, collapsible menus, etc.)

The changes are **live and working perfectly**! ðŸŽ‰
